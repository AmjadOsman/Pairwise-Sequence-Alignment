Dynamic programming

The repositiory contains a project implementing sequence alignment technique prevelent in bioinformatics. The first is global alignment which is an end to end alignment, it was implemented using Needleman–Wunsch algorithm [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm)

The second technique is local alignment is the highest region of similarity shared by both sequences, it was implemented using Smith–Waterman algorithm [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm)
